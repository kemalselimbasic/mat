# This is my final high school project

This project was made using **NodeJS**,**MongoDB**,**ExpressJS** and **EJS**.It was built as my high school wanted online grading system for a while and i just wanted to learn NodeJS and MongoDB.
PS. I know it's not very clean as it was my first node project but will get better i promise.


# Heroku

I recently deployed it on **Heroku** as a way to show it off as one of my projects for my portfolio.
